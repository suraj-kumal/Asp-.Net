# Project Title

This project is a demonstration of ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework Core, utilizing both database-first and code-first approaches. It also includes brief sections for integrating React, Angular, and Web API.

## ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework Core

### Database-First Approach

This section covers the database-first approach, where the database schema is created first, and then the models and context classes are generated from the existing database.

#### Steps to Use Database-First Approach:
1. Ensure the database is set up and populated with relevant tables and data.
2. Scaffold models and context from the existing database using Entity Framework Core tools.
   ```bash
   dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "connection_string" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
